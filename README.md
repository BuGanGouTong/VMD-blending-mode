##Requirements for model training
torch 1.12.1
numpy 1.21.5
pandas 1.2.4

##explanation
The code file contains the py files of all the models we used. In addition to SVM, which only uses grid search method for hyperparameter tuning, all the other models contain a baseline file and a genetic algorithm for hyperparameter tuning.
